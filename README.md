# Hi
Iâ€™m @david4jsus, you can call me David. Iâ€™m interested in things related to ðŸŽ¶ and ðŸŽ®, so I'm learning how to use the Unreal game engine to create games. My last project was a prototype for a third person platformer with fun movement gameplay mechanics (the repo for that is public). I think making games for HTML5 using JavaScript and Canvas is also fun (not most people's first choice, I know). Also, I'm currently working on a sample library manager app, because music production is fun, but it's a bit less fun when I have to spend a long time searching through my audio libraries trying to find that one sound file that I need.
